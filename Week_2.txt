Costs used by 
Economists
•Costs: Fixed Costs & Variable Costs
•Total Costs: TFC, TVC, TC
•Average Costs: AFC, AVC, ATC
•Marginal Costs
•Private Costs, External Costs, Social Costs
•Opportunity Costs
•Prospective costs and Sunk Costs
Sunk Costs
•Sunk Cost:  is the costs that are incurred in the past 
and can not be Refunded/ recovered by any future 
action
•E.g., Money spent on training of the staff of an 
organization…no matter what future action 
organization will have, that costs are done and 
cannot be recovered
•Economic theory states : ignore sunk costs , 
because they are paid in either case, and cannot be 
recovered
•Why…let see from an example9/16/2023
5
Sunk Costs (Cont.…)
•Let assume a business want to enter into new market 
with a new product
•The firm spend a lot on market research, product 
development, and advertisement
•The firm some how failed to enter in the market
•If the firm still continue on they very same product  
based on overall past investment into this failed 
project as a reason to keep it going ….will be not an 
“rational” decision
•These are sunk costs and must be ignored, if the 
product has no potential the firm should stop (must 
ignore the sunk costs) and should focused on new 
product. 
Sunk Costs Versus 
Sunk Fund
•There is another concept “ Sunk Fund ” 
that we will be using in this course at 
later stage
•It is not as such cost and it is not related 
with the Sunk Cost either
•But similar names… creates confusion 
quite often9/16/2023
6
Sinking fund
•Asinking fund is a fund established by 
aneconomic entity(such as a firm) by setting 
aside revenue over a period of time to fund a 
future capital expense , or repayment of a long -
term debt
•Sinking funds can also be used to set aside money 
for purposes of replacing capital equipment as it 
becomes obsolete , or major maintenance or renewal 
of elements of a fixed asset, typically a building
Engineering Costs9/16/2023
7
Operation and Maintenance Cost
(O&M Costs)
•Operation and Maintenance Cost is the group 
of costs experienced continually over the useful 
life of the activity… any example ?
•This includes costs like, labour costs for 
operating & maintenance personal , fuel and 
power costs , spare and repair part costs , costs 
for taxes etc.
•These costs can be substantial and can exceed 
the initial costs
Recurring & 
Non-recurring costs
•Recurring costs –known, anticipated and 
occurs at  regular intervals.
–Purchasing food, paying rent.
•Non-recurring costs -one-of-a-kind event 
that occurs at an irregular interval (some 
time called extra -ordinary costs too).
–Emergency maintenance expenses.
Sometimes we attempt to plan for large non -recurring costs 
by buying insurance.  Paying the periodic insurance premium 
turns this expense into a recurring cost.9/16/2023
8
Capital Cost
•Some time also called first cost, initial costs
•Capital costs are fixed, one -time expenses incurred 
on the purchase of land, buildings , construction
and equipment used in the production of goods or in 
rendering of services 
•Capital costs include expenses for tangible goods 
e.g., purchase of plants & machinery , also expenses 
for intangibles assets e.g., trademarks & software
development;
Capital Cost
•Unlike O&M Costs capital costs are one-time 
expenses but payment may be spread out 
over many years in financial reports and tax 
returns
•Capital costs are fixed and are therefore 
independent of the level of output9/16/2023
9
Incremental Costs
•An incremental cost is the difference between the 
costs of two alternatives.
Example
•Choose between alternative models A and B. What 
incremental costs occur with model B?
Cost Items A B
Purchase price 10,000.00$ 17,500.00$ 7,500.00$  
Installation costs 3,500.00$   5,000.00$   1,500.00$  
Annual maintenance costs 2,500.00$   750.00$      (1,750.00)$ 
Annual utility expenses 1,200.00$   2,000.00$   800.00$    
Disposal costs after useful life 700.00$      500.00$      (200.00)$   Model Costs

Time Value of Money
Would you prefer Rs. 1 million now or 
Rs. 1 million one year from now ?
Time Value of Money 
(TVM)
•A  Rupee (or dollar) received today is worth 
more than a rupee received tomorrow
–because a dollar received today can be 
invested to earn interest/return
–The amount of interest earned depends on the 
rate of return that can be earned on the 
investment
•Time value of money quantifies the value 
of a dollar through time
The  time value of money is the most important concept in 
engineering economics9/16/2023

Economic Equivalence
•Different sums of money at different times may be equal in 
economic value at a given rate
•$100 now is economically equivalent to $110 one year from 
now, if the $100 is invested at a rate of 10% per year0

•Economic Equivalence: Combination of interest rate 
(rate of return) and time value of money to determine 
different amounts of money at different points in time
that are economically equivalent9/16/2023

Interest
•What is Interest ?
–It is the manifestation (or display) of the time value of 
money
–Fee that one pays to use someone else’s money
–Computationally, interest is the difference between an 
ending amount of money and a beginning amount of 
money
•There are two perspectives for interest: 
1-Borrower’s perspective –Interest paid
Interest Paid= amount owed now –principal
2-Lender’s  or investor’s perspective –Interest Earned
Interest Earned= Total amount now –principal9/16/2023

Cash Flows (CFs): Basics
The costs and benefits of engineering projects occur over time and are 
summarized on a Cash Flow Diagram (CFD). 
Specifically, a CFD illustrates the size, sign, and timing of individual 
cash flows. In this way the CFD is the basis for engineering economic 
analysis.
CFs are amount of money estimated for future projects or observed for 
project events that have taken place
CFs are during specific time period
CF is difficult to estimate as its predicting future
There are three important concepts related to Cash flows: Cash Inflows , 
Cash Outflows , Net Cash flows9/16/2023
18
Cash Flows: Terms
•Cash Inflows –Revenues (R), receipts,  incomes, 
savings generated by projects and activities that flow in. 
represented with a plus sign and upward arrow
•Cash Outflows –Disbursements (D), costs, expenses, 
taxes caused by projects and activities that flow out. 
Represented with a minus sign and downward arrow
•Net Cash Flow (NCF) for each time period:
NCF = cash inflows –cash outflows = R –D
•End-of-period assumption :
Funds flow at the end of a given interest period (its 
important because cash may not flow in/out at the end 
of period always)
Cash Flows: Estimating
There are two ways for estimating Cash flows : 
Point estimate –A single -value estimate of a cash 
flow element of an alternative
Cash inflow: Income = $150,000 per month
Range estimate –Min and max values that 
estimate the cash flow 
Cash outflow: Cost is between $2.5 M and $3.2 M 
-Point estimates are commonly used; 
-however, range estimates with probabilities attached provide a better 
understanding of variability of economic parameters used to make 
decisions9/16/2023

•An engineer wants to deposit an amount Pnow 
such that she can withdraw an equal annual 
amount of A1= $3000 per year for the first 5 years, 
starting 1 year after the deposit, and a different 
annual withdrawal of A2= $5000 per year for the 
following 3 years. How would the cash flow

Minimum Attractive Rate 
of Return (MARR)
Also termed hurdle rate , 
benchmark rate and cutoff rate
MARR is a reasonable rate of 
return (percent) established 
for evaluating and selecting 
alternatives
An investment is justified 
economically if it is expected to 
return at least the MARR
MARR is established by the 
financial managers of the 
firm

•Equity financing:  uses of its own funds from cash 
on hand, stock sales, or retained earnings . 
Individuals can use their own cash, savings, or 
investments. When firm use its own money its called 
equity financing .  
•Debt financing: borrowing from outside sources and 
repays the principal and interest according to some 
schedule. Sources of debt capital may be bonds , 
loans etc. Individuals, too, can utilize debt sources , 
such as the credit card (15% rate) and bank options 
(9% rate) described above.Sources of Capital for firms9/16/2023
23
Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital (WACC)
•If capital is used from more than one source ….. Such as 
combinations of debt -equity financing …then the cost of 
capital is a weighted average cost of capital (WACC )
•If the HDTV is purchased with 40% credit card money at 15% 
per year and 60% savings account funds earning 5% per 
year, 
•the Weighted Average Cost of Capital is:
•0.4(15%) +  0.6(5%)  = 9 % per year .
•While making decisions for investment firms compares 
weighted average costs of capital with its expected rate 
of returns…. Return on project should be “ greater ” than 
Weighted average Cost of Capital ( WACC)
Class Practice
A large multinational 
corporation is considering 
following six projects. 
They are using  10% equity 
financing costing 9% per year 
and 90% debt financing with a 
cost of debt capital of 16 % per 
year, which projects should 
the company undertake in 
given projects Inventory, 
technology, warehouse, 
products, energy, shipping?
Solution
Return on project should 
be “greater ” than Weighted 
average Cost of Capital 
(WACC)
WACC = 10%(0.09) + 90%(0.16) = 15.3%
should undertake the inventory, technology , and 
warehouse projectsWhich one company should undertake ?9/16/2023

Commonly used Symbols
t=  time (time period) , usually in periods such as years 
or months
P= value or amount of money at a time t (principle)
designated as present or time 0
F= value or amount of money at some future 
time (Future value) , such as at t = n periods in 
the future 
A= series of consecutive, equal, end -of-period 
amounts of money (Annuity)
n= number of interest periods ; years, months
i= interest rate or rate of return per time period ; 
percent per year or month9/16/2023
25
Simple Interest
–Interest is calculated using principal only
–Mathematically:
Simple Interest = (principal) x (interest rate )x (number of periods )
I =    P       x        i x      n   
P= principle amount
n = number of period
i  = interest rate
Example
Green Tree Financing lent an engineering 
company $100,000 to retrofit an 
environmentally unfriendly building. The loan 
is for 3 years at 10% per year simple 
interest. How much money will the firm 
repay at the end of 3 years?
I = P x ix n
P= principle amount = $100,000
n = number of period = 3
i= interest rate = 10% or 0.1I = P x ix n 
I = $100,000 x 3 x 0.1
I = $30,000
Total due = $100,000 +30,000= $130,000Solution9/16/2023
26
Compound Interest Rate
•It must be noted that …. Banks do not use Simple 
Interest  instead they use “Compound Interest rate”
•Most of the time, we talk about interest we mean 
compound interest rate
•So when ever you are said to calculate interest rate 
and it is not specified …it will always mean 
COMPOUND Interest rate. So be careful with this 
distinction. 
Compound Interest
With Compound Interest, you work out the interest for the first period, 
add it to the principle, and then calculate the interest for the next period, 
and so on ..., like this: 
Let suppose You deposited $1000 in a bank with compound interest rate 
of 10%

Single Payment Compound 
Amount Factor (SPCAF)
If an amount “P” is invested at time “t=0” the amount accumulated after a year is 
given as
F1= P + Pi 
= P(1 + i) ………. (1 )
At the end of second year, the accumulated amount F2is given as;
F2= F1+ F1i
= P(1+i) + P(1+i) i (from Eq. 1)
= P + Pi + Pi+ Pi2
= P + 2Pi + Pi2
= P (1 + 2i + i2)
= P(1+i)2…………( 2)
Similarly; F3= F2+ F2i
= P(1+i)3………..(3 )
to generalize the process for period “n” we can write as ;
F = P(1+i)nP = 1000@5% 
After one year ?
F1= 1000 + 50
After two year ?
F2= 1050 + 52.5
Single Payment Compound 
Amount Factor (SPCAF)
•The term“(1+i)n” is known as Single Payment  
Compound Amount Factor (SPCAF) 
•It is also refer as F/P factor
•This is a converting factor, when multiplied by “P” 
yields the future amount “F” of initial amount “P” 
after “n” years at interest rate “ i”F = P(1+i)n

= $130,000Compound Interest
Now we have F = P(1+i)n
P = $100,000
n=3
i=10%
So  F = 100,000 (1+0.10)3
F= 100,000 (1.331)
F = 133100Simple and Compound Interest
Example: $100,000 lent for 3 years at interest rate i 
= 10% per year. What is repayment after 3 years ?
Simple: $130,000 : Compounded: $133,100
From SPCAF to SPPWF
•Now we have the formula how to “ convert ” single 
present amounts into future amount at a given 
interest rate i.e. F = P(1+i)n
•What if we are given a future amount (F) and we 
are asked to calculate present amount/value (P) ?
F  = P(1+i)n
=>  P  = F [1/(1+i)n]  
or    P  = F(1+i)-n9/16/2023

Single Payment Present 
Worth Factor (SPPWF)
The term“(1+i)‒n” is known as Single Payment  
Present Worth Factor (SPPWF) 
It is also refer as P/F factor
This is a converting factor, when multiplied by “ F” 
yields the present amount “P” of initial amount “ F” 
after “ n” years at interest rate “ i”P = F(1+i) −n
Compounding and 
Discounting
•When we convert a “ P” value into a “ F” using some 
rate … we call this process …. COMPOUNDING
and the rate use is called “ Interest rate ”
•When we convert “ F” into “ P” using some rate …we 
call the process … Discounting …and the rate we 
use is called “ Discount rate ”
•Compounding increase your amount (as its 
compounded)….discounting decrease your amount 
as its (discounted)9/16/2023
