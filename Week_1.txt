Setting the Scene
Lets start with a simple question ? What is 
Economics ? Anyone ?
There are variety of definitions of Economics but let 
me place the most relevant one for this course
A social science that studies how individuals, firms, 
governments and nations make choices on 
allocating scarce resources to satisfy their 
unlimited wants
Why Engineer Need to know about 
Economics ?
Individuals, Engineers, Managers all made choice 
among various alternatives in their every day life 
..Any Example ?
Mostly these choice is associate with money (more 
specifically capital or capital funds) but money (or 
resources) is limited
The selection of any choice depends on the 
expected future return of each alternative
Engineers plays a vital role in “such decision ” due 
to their ability and experience to design , analyze 
and synthesize9/10/2023

Engineers design and create
Designing involves economic decisions … Why ?
Engineers must be able to incorporate economic 
analysis into their creative efforts
Often engineers must select and implement from 
multiple alternatives
Understanding and applying  “engineering economy 
tools (such as time value of money , economic 
equivalence , and cost estimation) are vital for 
engineers 
A proper economic analysis for selection and 
execution is a fundamental task of engineeringWhy Engineer Need to know about

Where Engineering Economy/Economics 
learning is useful ?
It is useful in many different engineering decisions 
How should the engineering project be designed ?
Has civil or mechanical engineer chosen the best thickness 
for insulation ?
Which engineering projects should have a higher priority ?
Has the industrial engineer shown which factory 
improvement projects should be funded with the available 
resources
Which engineering projects are worthwhile ?
Has the mining or petroleum engineer shown that mineral or 
oil deposits is worth developing ?
Where Engineering Economy/Economics 
learning is useful ?
Cost -Benefit Analysis for Software Projects 
•Check if the potential benefits (e.g., increased revenue or 
efficiency) outweigh the costs (e.g., development and 
maintenance expenses). 
•In large IT organizations, budget allocation decisions are 
made based on cost -benefit analyses
Return on Investment (ROI) for Hardware and Software Upgrades 
•Expected ROI on hardware or software upgrades in a 
computing environment
•Information if the upgrades are financially justified and when 
they should be implemented .9/10/2023
10
Where Engineering Economy/Economics 
learning is useful ?
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis: 
•These analyses can help organizations understand the 
complete cost of owning and operating computer 
systems and software applications over their entire 
lifecycle 
Depreciation and Payback: 
•Engineers need to account for the depreciation of 
hardware and software assets over time
•Engineering economics techniques help in calculating 
depreciation schedules and payback for software 
development costs
Performing Engineering 
Economy Study
Keeping in mind, what is economics and 
engineering economy?  
For doing any engineering study we will 
need to do many things such as : 
Problem identifications , its objectives , its 
various alternatives , information about 
each alternatives , choosing the best 
among all alternatives etc.9/10/2023

Various Type of Costs
•There are different type of costs and can be 
classified by various ways
•We will discuss costs classifications mostly 
use by economists and Engineers
•Economists: Fixed & Variable Costs , Average Costs 
& Marginal Costs, Private & Social Costs
•Opportunity Costs 
•Some other important cost concept you may come 
across:  Sunk Cost (often confused with Sinking funds) , 
Operation & Maintenance Cost (O&M Costs ), Life-
cycle Costs  etc.
Fixed and Variable Costs 
•Fixed Cost s:  those costs that do not vary with 
the quantity of output produced .…any example  ?
Examples : rent to paid for factory building, interest on 
invested capital, maintenance, taxes etc.
•Variable Cost s: are those costs that do vary with 
the quantity of output produced
Examples :consumption of fuel for power generation ….it 
will vary as the production of a factory increases or 
decrease9/10/2023
14
Total Costs
•It maybe noted that Fixed Costs (FC) and 
Variable Costs(VC) may consist of more than 
one component and the sum of all respective 
components will make up TFC and TVC 
respectively
•Total Costs (TC) is equal to sum of Total 
Fixed Costs (TFC)  and Total variable costs 
(TVC):
TC= TFC + TVC
Average Costs
•Average Costs
–Average costs can be determined by dividing the 
firm’s total costs by the quantity of output it 
produces
–The average cost is the cost of each typical unit 
of product
•Average Costs can also be obtained by 
adding  Average Fixed Costs (AFC) and 
Average Variable Costs (AVC) … i.e:   
•ATC = AFC + AVC9/10/2023

$1000, what is the  average cost of the firm?

Marginal Costs
•Marginal Cost
–Marginal cost (MC) measures the increase in 
total cost that arises from an extra unit ( or next 
unit) of production
–Marginal cost helps answer the following 
question:
•How much does it cost to produce an additional unit 
of output?
(change in total cost)
(change in quantity)TCMCQ9/10/2023
16
Private / Social Cost
•Private costs (benefits ) of an action 
–accruing to the actor only 
•Social costs (benefits ) 
–total costs of activity including those that accrue 
to people other than the actor 
•Example: driving a car
–Private costs: fuel, maintenance 
–Social costs include pollution, road wear

The Next best use is “buying 
house” that’s I forgone for 
paying my Credit card debts so 
that’s my Opportunity cost
Opportunity Cost:
The Next Best Decision you could make9/10/2023

Opportunity Costs 
(Cont.….)
•What is cost of your “BS Engineering Degree” ?
•Fee you pay to GIKI ? 
•Food you pay for ?
•Books you bought and things you paid for?
•What about time you spend ?
•Cannot you use this time by “making some money” 
instead of studying?
•Economist make decision based on “opportunity 
cost” not based on monetary cost “only”
•Opportunity cost is the cost of second best choice 
you left for doing/getting your first choice

Prospective Costs
•Prospective cost is a future expenditure or 
past cost that can be recovered
•In other words, it is any cost that can be 
altered by your current or future decisions and 
strategies
•Economic theory says….to make a decision 
about business focus on “perspective costs” 
•Because these costs can be “controlled”
